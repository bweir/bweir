### Hi there 👋

I work on infrastructure and tools of all shapes and sizes. These days I spent a lot of time in the cloud. ☁️

Some things I've worked on:

- [LameStation](https://www.lamestation.com/) - a game console you can build.

- [PropellerIDE](https://github.com/parallaxinc/PropellerIDE) - a friendly IDE for the Spin programming language.
